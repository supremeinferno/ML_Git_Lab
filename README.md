This repository is created as part of a Machine Learning Git Lab Assignment. The objective of this project is to understand and apply version control concepts using Git and GitHub in a Machine Learning workflow.

The project demonstrates how Git is used to manage Machine Learning code, track changes, and maintain different versions of models. A local Git repository was initialized, files were committed with proper commit messages, branches were created for experimentation, and changes were merged into the main branch.

A small sample dataset is used only for demonstration purposes. The dataset contains Area as the input feature and Price as the target variable. The dataset is stored in a CSV file.

Initially, a Linear Regression model was implemented to train the dataset. Later, a Decision Tree Regressor model was developed in a separate Git branch to demonstrate branching in Git. After testing, the branch was successfully merged into the main branch.

The final version of the project was pushed to GitHub, demonstrating proper use of commits, branching, merging, and remote repository management.
